1. If printf treats % as the beginning of a conversion specification, how can I print the % character?
printf("%%\n");
printf("%c\n", '%');
printf("%s\n", "%");

2. What does scanf do if it's asked to read a number but the user enters nonnumeric input?
- If the user enters a number (matches the specifier) then non-numeric scanf(): reads and stores the number while the rest are still in stdin. (cause residual values)
-But if the user enters non-numeric first: scanf reads nothing and all inputted values are still in stdin.
3. What does scanf do if the user puts punctuation marks (commas, for example) between numbers?
- It reads and stores the first number then terminate when find a comma so the comma and remaining numbers are left for next scanf. 
4. Suppose that we call scant as follows: scanf ("%d%f%d”, &i, &x, &j ) ; If the user enters: 10.3 5 6 What will be the values of i, x, and j after the call? (Assume that i and j are int variables and x is a float variable.)
- i = 10, x = 0.300000 and j = 5
5. Suppose that we call scanf as follows: scanf ( "%f%d%f " , &x, &i, &y) ; If the user enters: 12.3 45.6 789 What will be the values of x, i. and y after the call? (Assume that x and y are float variables and i is an int variable.)
- x = 12.300000, i = 45 and y = 0.600000
6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number in the form (xxx) xxx-xxxx and then displays the number in the form xxx.xxx.xxx: Enter phone number [(xxx) xxx-xxxx]: (404) 817-6900 You entered 404.817.6900
#include <stdio.h> /* include the standard library */

int main(void)
{
    int x, y, z; /* declaration of local variables */
    /* ask user to input the number as the format shown below */
    printf("Enter phone number [(xxx) xxx-xxxx]: ");
    /* reads the input numbers and stores it at x, y and z */
    scanf("(%d) %d-%d", &x, &y, &z);
    /* prints the three numbers separated with dot */
    printf("%d.%d.%d", x, y, z);
}

7. Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) and then displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals: Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order: 16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1 Output: 16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1 Row sums: 34 34 34 34 Column sums: 34 34 34 34 Diagonal sums: 34 34
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9;
    int x10,x11,x12,x13,x14,x15,x16;

    printf("Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:");
    scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d",
          &x1,&x2,&x3,&x4,&x5,&x6,&x7,&x8,&x9,&x10,&x11,&x12,&x13,&x14,&x15,&x16);

    printf("%d %d %d %d\n%d %d %d %d\n%d %d %d %d\n%d %d %d %d\n",
           x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10,x11,x12,x13,x14,x15,x16);

    printf("Row sums: %d %d %d %d\n",(x1+x2+x3+x4), (x5+x6+x7+x8) ,
           (x9+x10+x11+x12),(x13+x14+x15+x16));

    printf("Column sums: %d %d %d %d\n",(x1+x5+x9+x13), (x2+x6+x10+x14) ,
           (x3+x7+x11+x15),(x4+x8+x12+x16));

    printf("Diagonal sums: %d %d\n",(x1+x6+x11+x16), (x4+x7+x10+x13));

    return 0;
}

8. What does the following code print? printf( "*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n" );
- A left aligned triangle shape
*
**
***
****
*****

9. State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following C statements and Show the value of x after each statement is performed. 
a) x = 8 + 15 * ( 6 – 2) - 1; 
b) x = 5 % 5 + 5 * 5 - 5 / 5; 
c) x = ( 5 * 7 * ( 5 + ( 7 * 5 / ( 7 ) ) ) );

-	a) () then – then * then + then –
x = 8 + 15 * (4) – 1 =
      8 + 60 – 1 = 68 – 1 = 67  
-	b) % then * then / then + the -
x = 0 + 5 * 5 – 5 / 5
   = 0 + 25 – 5 / 5 
   = 0 + 25 – 1 = 24
-	c) () then * then / then + then * 
x = ( 5 * 7 * ( 5 + ( 7 * 5 / ( 7 ) ) ) )
   = ( 5 * 7 * ( 5 + ( 35 / 7 ) )
   = ( 5 * 7 * ( 5 + 5 ))
   = ( 5 * 7 * ( 10 )) = 350 
10. (Arithmetic) Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, obtains them from the user and prints their sum, product, difference, quotient and remainder.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    /* declaration of variables */
    int num1, num2;
    int sum, prod, dfrnc, qotnt, remdr; 

    /* ask user for input */
    printf( "Enter number 1:");
    scanf("%d", &num1);
    printf( "Enter number 2:");
    scanf("%d", &num2);

    /* definition of arithmetic operations */
    sum = num1 + num2;
    prod = num1 * num2;
    dfrnc = num1 - num2;
    qotnt = num1 / num2;
    remdr = num1 % num2;

    /* display the results */
    printf("Sum = %d\nProduct = %d\nDifference = %d\n", sum, prod, dfrnc);
    printf("Quotient = %d\nRemainder = %d\n", qotnt, remdr);

    return 0;
}
